# SLPRT: Sign Language Praat Project

This project is organized in this way

├── src
│   ├── src_vid
│   ├── dest_vid
│   ├── grph
│   ├── embed
├── codes

Only codes will be commited and synced across devices, as these are small files and will be modified heavily. The srcs will are too large to be hosted on github, therefore, they will be transmitted separately, probably through Onedrive or portable USB.
